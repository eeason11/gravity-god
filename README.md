# gravity-god
#### Computer game based on "Gravity Guy"
#### Developed in C.
#### Contributors: Alison Noyes, Ethan Eason (myself), Kellen Rodriguez, and Hannah Fan.
#### Project was split into two phases:
  #### Phase 1 involved developing and testing a basic physics library/engine.
  #### Phase 2 involved planning, designing, implementing, and testing our game's features based on our physics library.
#### Before each phase, we delegated tasks and responsibilities and assigned priority levels to each of our tasks.
#### Total project was completed in a 10 week period.
