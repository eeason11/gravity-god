# Any .o file in "out" is built from the corresponding C file.
# Although .c files can be directly compiled into an executable, first building

# gets recompiled, and clang reuses the other .o files to build the executable.
#
# "%" means "any string".
# Unlike "all", this target has a build command.
# "$^" is a special variable meaning "the source files"
# and $@ means "the target file", so the command tells clang
# to compile the source C file into the target .o file.

# "for f in $(TEST_BINS); do ...; done" loops over the test executables,
#    assigning the variable f to each one
# "$$f" runs the test; "$$" escapes the $ character,

# "echo" prints a newline after each test's output, for readability
